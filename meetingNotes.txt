Session 1.

- We came up with the Initial idea of a bingo board with tiles contianing sustainnability goals which are marked off when completed. When the user gets a bingo win condition (4 In a row either Horizontally, Vertically, or diagonally), they gain an in game currency: Leaf Coins. With these coins they can purchase plant packets for plants to add to their virtual gardens.

- The grid will be 4x4, resetting every week.
- 6 or so will be a visiting tiles, requiring the user to walk to a specific location.
- Types of tiles:
   Visit Location, Visit Wesbite, Complete a quiz
- The types of plants will have different rarities:
- Common, Rare, Epic, Legendary

- Potential Plants:

  Moss - Common
  Oak tree - Common
  Grass - Common
  Dandelion - Common

  Sunflower - Rare
  Birch Tree - Rare

  Venus FlyTrap - Epic
  Dripleaf - Epic

  Bonzai tree - Legendary
  Monkey Tree - Legendary
  Dragons Blood Tree - Legendary
  Yggdrasil - Legendary

- We did research about the rarity of plants and which category they will fit.
